My App

This android application is designed to read questions and answers from a cloud database created from the information at jarchive.com.
The cloud database is updated by a parser also available on my github page. The application serves questions and answers to the user based
on their requests using the application's UI. As the user completes questions a local database on the user's android device is updated so that the user
can track their completion.
